## Contributing

Before you start working, it's better to open an issue to discuss first.

## Code Style

This project uses [@antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) to enforce consistent code style.

Enable `Run eslint --fix on save` in your editor to automatically fix issues.

### WebStorm
